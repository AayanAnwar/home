                I woke up with a start, feeling a sharp pain in my head as well as my back.I felt some pressure on chest- there was a heavy cloak on top of me. I tried to sit up, but as I did, I felt something soft on my chest. I looked down and noticed that on top of my heavy cloak, a few fluffy chicks were sleeping. I slowly laid back down. Where am I? I tried to make sense of my surrounding, so I looked around. I was in a sort of barn, there was hay on the floor, however, it was evident that there were no animals kept here, save for, perhaps, the tiny chicks. The walls were made of wood, and there was a lantern atop me, as well as a few other beds made of lumps of hay. I realised that I was lying on one of these.
